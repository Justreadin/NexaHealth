💠 NexaHealth Pharmacy Rating System (Smart + MVP-Friendly)
🎯 Goal

Quantify trustworthiness based on pharmacy behavior, not consumer opinions.
The system updates automatically as pharmacies engage with NexaHealth features.

⚙️ Core Rating Principle

Each pharmacy has a “Trust Score” (0–100).
It’s calculated dynamically from verified activity signals, e.g.:

Category	Metric	Example Impact
Verification Activity	How often they verify drugs on the Nexa platform	+2 pts per verified item (max +20/month)
ADR / Fake Drug Reporting	Reports filed & confirmed valid	+5 pts per valid report
Responsiveness	How quickly they respond to reported issues / patient concerns	+1–3 pts per prompt resolution
User Engagement	Number of patient verifications linked to their pharmacy	+1 pt per 10 verifications
Compliance	Verified license, address, and regulatory docs (e.g., NAFDAC)	+20 pts
Penalty	False reports or inactivity over time	−10 pts

✅ No public ratings, just a transparent, evolving score backed by verifiable actions.

💎 Trust Levels
Score Range	Level	Badge
80–100	Trusted Pharmacy	🟢 Gold Glow
60–79	Verified Pharmacy	🔵 Blue Glow
40–59	Registered Pharmacy	⚪ Gray Badge
0–39	Pending Verification	⚫ No Glow

These badges automatically update based on the Trust Score.

🧠 Smart Extension (Later Stage AI Integration)

Once you gather enough behavioral data, NexaHealth can introduce AI-driven trust predictions:

Predict pharmacy risk level (likelihood of selling fake drugs)

Flag anomalies in drug verification patterns

Recommend top trusted pharmacies nearby using a TrustRank Algorithm

🧩 MVP Implementation (Simple + Realistic)

You don’t need AI now — start with:

A Trust Score field in your pharmacies table

An Activity Log that tracks:

verified_drugs_count

reports_made

adr_reports

documents_verified

last_active_date

Then a backend function (e.g., calculate_trust_score(pharmacy_id)) that runs weekly or in real-time.

🌍 Visual Display (UI)

Each pharmacy card shows:

Pharmacy Name

City

Badge + Score (e.g. “Trust Score: 87”)

Subtext: “Based on verified activity on NexaHealth”

Glowing ring color = trust level

🪄 Result

You get:

A self-regulating ecosystem (the more pharmacies act right, the more visible they become)

A trust-based leaderboard instead of fake reviews

And a data reputation moat — something copycats can’t fake easily
