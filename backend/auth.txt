Frontend Integration
Your frontend can now call these endpoints:

POST /auth/signup - User registration

POST /auth/login - Email/password login

POST /auth/google-login - Google OAuth login

POST /auth/request-password-reset - Initiate password reset

POST /auth/reset-password - Complete password reset

GET /auth/me - Get current user info

The frontend should store the JWT token returned from login/signup and include it in the Authorization header for protected routes:


look at this for my app, i don't want it compulsory for people to signup or login to use the app, they can just enter the app use the features but they can only access features like user history and other related stuffs that can only be accessible if they signup and login of which after creating an account all activities during the sessions are saved.
