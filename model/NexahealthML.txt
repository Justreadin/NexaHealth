üî∑ PHASE 1: Strategy and Architecture (0‚Ç¶)
1. Model Choice: Start With Open-Source LLMs
Instead of building from scratch (which is extremely compute-intensive), fine-tune an existing lightweight model like:

Phi-2 (by Microsoft) ‚Äì very efficient, excellent reasoning

Mistral 7B ‚Äì powerful, multilingual

TinyLLaMA or LLaMA 3 8B ‚Äì low-resource, better reasoning

BloomZ (Multilingual) ‚Äì trained on 46 languages incl. African languages

2. Languages
Use a multilingual pretrained base (like Mistral + BLOOMZ) and fine-tune on:

Common Crawl/Yor√πb√°, Igbo, Hausa datasets (see below)

English health conversations (ChatDoctor, MedDialog, MedQuAD)

Local terminologies (from NAFDAC, PILs, PQC)

üî∑ PHASE 2: Data Collection & Curation (0‚Ç¶)
1. Your Private Dataset
Drug DB

PILs (Patient Information Leaflets)

Pharmacovigilance terms

AE reports, PQC explanations
Organize by: [Drug name], [Symptoms], [Usage], [Side Effects], [Red flags], [Language version]

2. Free/Open-source Medical Datasets
Dataset	Description
MedQuAD	QA pairs from NIH
MedDialog (EN/CH)	Doctor-patient chats
PubMedQA	Q&A from medical literature
ChatDoctor	Fine-tuned model/data on MedDialog
DrugComb, DrugBank	Drug interactions
WHO Terminology DB	Disease names in multiple languages

3. Local Language Health Data
Masakhane Project (has Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba corpora)

AI4D Africa, Lafand Dataset (Yoruba/Hausa conversational)

Translate MedDialog into local languages using NLLB (No Language Left Behind by Meta)

üî∑ PHASE 3: Training Without Funding
1. Training Strategy
Use LoRA + QLoRA (Parameter-efficient tuning) to fine-tune on:

4 languages (Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, English)

Medical questions, drug info, mental health

Your internal drug DB

Train using:

Google Colab Pro or Kaggle GPUs

RunPod.io (cheap GPU rental)

Local GPU (if you have 16GB+ RAM and 6GB+ VRAM)

2. Model Tools
Transformers + PEFT (from HuggingFace)

QLoRA + bitsandbytes for low-RAM training

Text generation with LangChain or Haystack

üî∑ PHASE 4: Building the Health Companion (Multilingual Bot)
1. Frontend
Your current UI (mobile/web chat)

2. Backend
FastAPI + LangChain or RAG pipeline

Query:

Your vector store (FAISS or ChromaDB) of medical knowledge

Your fine-tuned AI model for response generation

3. Language Routing
Use a simple language classifier (transformers or keyword detection)

Route queries to either English or local language response pipeline

üî∑ PHASE 5: Improve with Feedback
Add feedback loop to learn from user corrections (RLHF later)

Add confidence scoring to detect hallucinations or risk

üî∑ Tools You‚Äôll Use (All Free/Open Source)
Tool	Purpose
HuggingFace	Models, training, datasets
LangChain	AI agent architecture
FAISS/Chroma	Embedding search (drug DB, PILs)
NLLB-200	Translation into Igbo/Yoruba/Hausa
Google Colab / Kaggle	Training
Gradio	Demo health assistant
OpenWebUI / GPT4All UI	Local chat UI for testing

üß† Example Workflow
User enters: ‚ÄúIna jin ciwon ciki bayan na sha magani‚Äù

Your pipeline:

Language = Hausa ‚Üí Translate to English

Embed user query ‚Üí search FAISS + generate answer

Generate Hausa answer via NLLB or multilingual model

Return: "Ka daina amfani da maganin. Da alama yana da illa. Ziyarci asibiti."

üìå What Makes It Stand Out:
Offline-compatible (with quantized LLMs)

Multilingual (local + English)

Culturally-aware answers

Drug-safe recommendations backed by real data

Realtime updates from NAFDAC/PILs

‚úÖ You Don‚Äôt Need:
GPT-4 API

Expensive cloud compute

Proprietary datasets
